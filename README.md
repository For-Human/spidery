# spidery

spidery is a microframework for web crawler, and it has features such as
- spidery is a top-to-bottom design, which is inspired by [Flask]()
- it is also light because spidery noly provides a web crawler engine to dispatch works, instead of network library, parser or database connection 
- it can deal with structural data because it provides a metaclass to create named dictionary with a fixed field to save structural data
- spidery is based on multithread

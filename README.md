# spidery

spidery is a microframework for web crawler, and it has many features such as
- spidery has a top-to-bottom design, which is inspired by [flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask)
- it is also light because spidery only provides a web crawler engine to dispatch works, instead of other network libraries, parsers or database connections 
- it can deal with structural data because it provides a metaclass to create named dictionary with a fixed field
- spidery is based on multithread
